Introduction

The Shark Deterrence Algorithm is a project aimed at providing a technological solution to the challenge of ensuring human safety in the ocean without harming marine life. The algorithm detects when sharks approach too closely to humans and triggers a series of deterrent sound waves to steer them away.

Features

	â€¢	Real-Time Shark Detection: Continuously monitors the position of sharks relative to humans in the ocean.
	â€¢	Deterrent Sound Waves: Activates sound waves to gently guide sharks away from humans.
	â€¢	Safety Navigation: Directs humans towards a safe point, ensuring they move away from sharks.
	â€¢	Multiple Sound Frequencies: Utilizes various sound wave frequencies to create an effective barrier.
	â€¢	Respect for Marine Life: The system ensures that sharks are not harmed during the deterrence process.
